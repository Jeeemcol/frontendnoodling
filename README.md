# Frontend Noodling with React

This project is an exploration into React along with frontend design techniques and JavaScript animation libraries. It serves as a playground to test, learn, and experiment with modern web technologies.

## Structure

- The main application is set up using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).
- Animations can be integrated using libraries like [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
cd frontendnoodling

2. **Install Dependencies:**
npm install

3. **Start the Development Server:**
npm start


This will open a browser window pointing to `http://localhost:3000/` displaying the app.

## Exploration and Development

- `src/App.js`: This is the main component file. Start your journey here.
- To integrate animations, consider adding GSAP or AOS as mentioned above.
- Style your components using either plain CSS or SCSS (after setting up SCSS).

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Integrate React Router for multi-page functionality.
- [ ] Explore more advanced animations and transitions.
- [ ] Add state management solutions if complexity increases.
